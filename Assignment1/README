1. Write a program in both iterative and recursive approaches that prints out the Fibonacci𝑛𝑡ℎ
element(not the whole sequence). Name the method as you like(e.g., fibonacciIteration(int n)
and fibonacciRecursion(int n)). Please consider the efficiency of the two methods in terms of
Time Complexity and type the Big-O notation down as comments. Call the method that is more
efficient in the main method. (15 pts)

2. Based on the program you created, further develop the program that adds each Fibonacci
number(starting from 0, 1) to a list(an array), and can perform remove, ifContains, grab, and
numItems operations. (35 pts)
● add(int item): add a number to the list (allow to add duplicates)
● remove(int item): remove the item (if exists) from the list
● ifContains(int item): check if the item exists in the list
● grab(): random draw a number from the list without removing
● numItems(): prints out the number of unique items in the list (without duplicates)
